The Global Auto Brands Ranking
In 2020, Toyota reached 10.1% share with sales at 8.06 million, after further widening the gap from the followers during the Covid-19 crisis. Toyota – together with Kia, Mercedes, and BMW – was one of the least damaged top 10 brands by the Coronavirus pandemic – actually losing 12.2% from the previous year. In recent years, the market share was ranging between a minimum of 9.2% (in 2016 and 2017) and a maximum of 10% (in 2019) and is now at 10.1%

Furthermore, tracking the ranking of top-selling car brands in the World since 2010, we have always seen Toyota leading the scene. Indeed, the Japanese benefit from the strategy to have concentrated in a single brand the most powerful line-up in the World and while other manufacturers have assembled different brands aiming to cover more customer segments, Toyota has just a little diversification in the one-brand strategy, with Lexus in the luxury segment and Daihatsu in the small, low-cost vehicles.

Volkswagen – in 2nd position – has lost terrain during the Covid-19 crisis, due to its large dependence on the Chinese market, which counts for over 40% of global sales.  This year the German brand held 7.1% share, falling 0.4%, and sold 5.73 million vehicles (-16.8%)

Mercedes-Benz is both a German automotive marque and, from late 2019 onwards, a subsidiary – as Mercedes-Benz AG – of Daimler AG. Mercedes-Benz is known for producing luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles. The headquarters is in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg. The name first appeared in 1926 as Daimler-Benz.

Behind, Honda has conquered the 3rd position with 4.33 million units (-14.1%), while outpacing Ford (-18.3%) which reported 4.18 million units, followed by Nissan with 3.80 million units (-19.5%). 

In 6th position, Hyundai reported 3.71 million sales (-15.22%), followed by the worst performer in the leaderboard, Chevrolet, which fell 22.4% with 2.96 million units sold and by Kia, which on the other hand reported the top 10 hold with 2.69 million units sold (-4.6%).

Closing the leaderboard we have Mercedes with 2.43 million units (-8.4%), followed by  BMW -a new entry in the leaderboard- reporting 2.05 million units (-8.4%).

However, the star of the year is certainly Tesla. The American brand jumped in 39th position, with 538.038 units sold (+46.2%), surpassing the goal they had set themselves of surpassing the 500.000 vehicles sold mark.
